**Help Document Finder** is a simple, web-based tool developed using embedded JavaScript, with code generated by ChatGPT, guided by input from Mike Young.

The tool takes keyword input from the user in real-time and dynamically searches a JSON file to match those keywords to help documentation titles and URLs. The goal is to quickly connect users with relevant technical support resources.

🔍 **Search Logic**

Recent enhancements includes keyword weighting for more refined searching:

- The first keyword is weighted at value 3
- The second at value 2
- Any additional keywords are weighted at value 1

This improves result relevance by prioritizing the terms users type first.

Additionally, fuzzy searching was added with the assistance of fuse.js.

🎯 **Purpose**

The Help Document Finder is designed to help end users quickly find self-help resources—primarily documentation, images, and videos—hosted internally, mostly on Google Drive. These resources are created and maintained within the organization and are curated for accuracy and usefulness.

🔄 **Content Management**

The supporting JSON file, which contains the resource titles, URLs, and associated keywords, is updated as needed to reflect newly added resources, updates, or for removal of outdated content.

💡 **Why This Exists**

While the organization already maintains a searchable Google Site with extensive help documentation, this tool provides a more direct keyword-to-resource mapping. It’s meant to offer a streamlined, lightweight alternative that cuts through clutter and helps users find what they need faster.
